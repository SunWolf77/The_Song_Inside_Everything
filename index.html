      <p>One bright morning, Luna opened her window. Milo hopped beside her.<br>
      A breeze moved through the leaves, and wild King Parrots and other native birds answered one another from her yard all the way out to the forest.<br>
      “Eep!”—“Eep!”<br>
      Luna loved listening, imagining the whole world singing together in time.</p>

      <p>Luna sat on the grass amongst the sights, sounds, and smells of the morning. She closed her eyes and smiled.<br>
      The day felt and sounded like kindness!<br>
      Luna really loved listening to the morning songs of the world so much!<br>
      Her ‘Heart Garden’ shimmered in the soft light. Butterflies, bees, and flowers humming quietly in their own way.</p>

      <img src="assets/2f.png" alt="Mr. Orion teaching resonance">
      <p>At school, Luna’s teacher, Mr. Orion, smiled.<br>
      “When things move together, they resonate!” he told the class.<br>
      He struck a tuning fork — <em>ding!</em> — and the tuning fork in his other hand began to sing too!<br>
      Luna’s eyes widened. “It’s like they’re singing together!”</p>
    </section>

    <section style="--i:4">
      <img src="assets/9.png" alt="Classroom singing The Heart’s Own Melody">
      <p>In class, Luna noticed how everyone’s laughter filled the room like music. Every voice different, and yet somehow connected.<br>
      Mr. Orion wrote on the board: “Resonance = Harmony = Love.”<br>
      Luna smiled with her heart.</p>

    <section style="--i:5">
      <img src="assets/Water_ripples.png" alt="Luna and her father with bowl of water">
      <p>At home, Luna and her father filled a bowl with water. He tapped the edge, and the surface rippled like tiny hills.<br>
      “Sound travels in waves,” he said. “Even though we can’t see it, everything that moves makes waves.”<br>
      Luna leaned in, eyes bright. The ripples met and danced like little circles crossing and rejoining.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="--i:6">
      <img src="assets/Singing_bowl.png" alt="Luna using singing bowl">
      <p>Later, Luna tried a singing bowl. She gently tapped the bowl with the wooden wand and then circled the rim on the outside.<br>
      A magical shimmering note rose up, and the bowl’s ‘voice’ grew clear and strong.<br>
      Her Dad smiled. “That’s resonance. When the motion matches the bowl’s rhythm, the sound blossoms.”</p>
    </section>

    <section style="--i:7">
      <img src="assets/p8_classshare.jpg" alt="Luna meditating in sunlight">
      <p>Luna began to notice songs hiding everywhere! The whisper of clouds, the buzz of wires, even the golden pulse of sunlight.<br>
      She wondered if the Sun itself was singing, a song so deep and wide that only the Earth could hear it.</p>

    <section style="--i:8">
      <img src="assets/1000016818.png" alt="Luna and father under starry sky">
      <p>That evening, Luna and her father stepped outside beneath a soft, star-dusted sky.<br>
      “There are rhythms all around us,” her father said. “Even the Earth has its own steady heartbeat, known as the Schumann resonance.”</p>

    <section style="--i:9">
      <img src="assets/p9_window_moon.jpg" alt="Luna and Milo at the moonlit window">
      <p>Just before bedtime, Luna sat by her window in the soft light of the full moon.<br>
      Milo curled up beside her, purring softly.<br>
      She gazed at the moonlight and remembered everything she’d learned about resonance. The tuning forks, the bowls, the songs of bees and birds and everything singing together.</p>

    <section style="--i:10">
      <img src="assets/p10_final_aurora.jpg" alt="Luna asleep under aurora sky">
      <p>As she drifted into dreams, Luna wondered if there were Heart Gardens made with other stars’ beautiful bright shining light too, in loving resonance of life everywhere!<br>
      “Maybe resonance is how everything in nature sings ‘good morning’ and ‘goodnight’ to each other — like a song inside EVERYTHING!”</p>
